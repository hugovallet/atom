Purpose
-------

Atom implements a problem-agnostic *structured clustering* approach that can be be used to
tackle a wide variety of segmentation and clustering problems. It implements a sklearn-looking
"pipeline" architecture that allows data scientists to build efficiently segmentations that
combine deterministic rules (business rules to classify quantities) and statistical clustering
(e.g. K-means).

It leverages graphviz to allow datascientists to visualise their segmentations pipelines as
directed acyclic graphs.
